```Student Essay``` : Because immediately after the collision of the bullet and the block all energy is \nkinetic, because at the moment the block reaches its max height all energy is \npotential, and finally because total energy is constant in the system, I was able \nto equate the kinetic energy after the collision with the potential energy at the \nmax height and was able to use that to solve for V in the kinetic equation.
