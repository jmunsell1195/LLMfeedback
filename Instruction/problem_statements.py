ballistic_pendulum_statement = '''In words, describe the general strategy that you could use to to answer the following question : 
A bullet of mass m is fired horizontally into a block of mass M at an unknown speed v. Since the initial speed is unknown you cannot use conservation of momentum. The block is suspended vertically by a string attached to a fixed support. The bullet becomes embedded in the block. Subsequently, the block with the bullet embedded in it rises to a height h. What is the speed, V of the block, with the bullet embedded in it, immediately after the collision, in terms of h?'''
